## Generation Prompt

Copy and customize for AI image generation (Gemini, Midjourney, etc.):

```
Generate a sprite sheet for an animated desktop pet character.

LAYOUT:
- 8 columns × 9 rows grid
- Each cell is a square frame (equal width and height)
- Aspect ratio: 8:9
- Recommended output: 4K+ (e.g. 4096×4608, giving 512×512 per frame)

BACKGROUND:
- Every pixel outside the character must be pure magenta #FF00FF
- No gradients, no shadows on background, no texture, no noise
- The character itself must not contain magenta or near-magenta colors
- No magenta reflections, outlines, or glow on the character

ANIMATION:
- Each row is one animation loop; frames progress left to right
- Adjacent frames must transition smoothly — no sudden jumps
- Character should stay centered in each frame
- Keep consistent size and proportions across all 72 frames

ROW DEFINITIONS (top to bottom):
- Row 1: Idle — relaxed, gentle breathing motion, occasional blink. Not static.
- Row 2: Walking — movement animation suggesting walking forward
- Row 3: Looking Around — head/body turning left and right, curious
- Row 4: Sleeping — eyes closed, resting, gentle breathing. No yawning (it loops).
- Row 5: Working — focused expression, sitting at a tiny keyboard
- Row 6: Playful — having fun with a small toy, lighthearted energy
- Row 7: Happy — bright expression, joyful body language, small hearts or sparkles
- Row 8: Sad — dejected, looking down, low energy, lonely
- Row 9: Being Held — picked up or carried, limbs dangling, mildly annoyed

CHARACTER: [describe your character]
STYLE: [e.g. "cute, photo-realistic" or "pixel art" or "chibi anime"]
```

## Processing

V4 is the canonical sprite-sheet cleanup pipeline for TinyRoommate.

Install the image tooling once:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pillow numpy
```

After generating, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/process-spritesheet-v4.py path/to/your-character-source.png \
  -o public/sprites/your_character.png \
  --cols 8 --rows 9 --target 128
```

Then generate the preview assets used by the README:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-preview-gif.py public/sprites/your_character.png \
  -o assets/previews/your_character.gif \
  --still-output assets/previews/your_character.png
```

That gives you the repo's standard asset set:

- `public/sprites/your_character.png`: the in-app spritesheet
- `assets/previews/your_character.gif`: animated preview for docs
- `assets/previews/your_character.png`: still preview image

## Register Your Character

Add an entry to `src/characters.js`:

```js
// In CHARACTERS:
your_character: { defaultName: 'Name', displayName: 'Your Character' },

// In VOICE:
your_character: {
  greet: '👋',
  acks: ['~♪', '😊', 'hehe', 'hey!', '💛'],
  petHold: 'hehe~ 😊',
  petLines: ['hehe~', 'more...', 'nice~ 😊', "don't stop~"],
  petFallback: 'hehe~ 😊',
  tapLines: ['hm?', '!', 'hey?', '~'],
  tapFallback: 'hey?',
  chatFallback: 'hmm?',
},
```

The character picker UI is generated automatically from this file. Once `public/sprites/your_character.png` exists, your character appears in Settings automatically.
